# Software Systems Student Society (SSSS) Events Portal

## Vision
The Events Portal will be a centralized platform designed to streamline how our society handles our events from our Board Games Nights to our annual 100 member hackathons. (We just want to move away from google forms, luma registrations, and messy spreadsheets)

## Porposed Key Features 
* **Member Dashboard:** A dashboard for students to view upcoming events, manage their RSVPs, and access event-specific resources like information pages/handbooks.
* **Admin Command Center:** Tools for event leads to create events, monitor registration numbers in real-time, and manage participant data.
* **"Hackathon Mode" (High-Scale):** More support for larger events, featuring unique QR code generation for every participant and a mobile-friendly scanner for instant check-ins.

## Tech Stack
> **Status: To be determined.** > We will be discussing our preferred languages and frameworks during our upcoming committee meetings. We are looking for a stack that is scalable, easy to maintain, and beginner-friendly for new contributors.

## Project Status: Planning Phase
We are currently in the high-level design phase. 
- **Target Launch:** Within 1 year
