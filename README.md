# Software Systems Student Society (SSSS) Events Portal

**[ Architecture ](./ARCHITECTURE.md)**

Welcome to the **Events Portal** repository, a sub-project maintained by the SSSS Website Committee.

## Project Vision
The Events Portal will be a centralized platform designed to streamline how our society handles our events from our Board Games Nights to our annual 100 member hackathons. (We just want to move away from google forms, luma registrations, and messy spreadsheets)

## Porposed Key Features 
* **Member Dashboard:** A dashboard for students to view upcoming events, manage their RSVPs, and access event-specific resources like information pages/handbooks.
* **Admin Command Center:** Tools for event leads to create events, monitor registration numbers in real-time, and manage participant data.

## Tech Stack
> **Status: To be determined.** > We will be discussing our preferred languages and frameworks during our upcoming committee meetings.
